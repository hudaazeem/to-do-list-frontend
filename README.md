# To Do List

This is a to-do list web app made for the Athena Award.

This is the front-end repository for my project, with no time tracked... to view my backend, where my time was tracked, click the link below.

#### Back-end repository: https://github.com/hudaazeem/to-do-list

### Features

* Pomodoro timer
* 5 different website themes
* Custom cursors matching the selected website theme
* Confetti effect when users complete a task
* Text showing how many pomodoros are completed
* Text showing percentage of tasks completed.


### Why I made this project

I thought that making a to-do list would be a great way to start learning backend with Node.js and Express. I also love using to-do lists, so this was a useful project to make for myself to use. 

### How I made my project

* Node.js and Express for backend
* HTML and CSS for frontend
* MongoDB to store users' data after restarting the server
* W3Schools as a reference for front-end
* The Athena Express YSWS website as a reference for the back end 
* Google Fonts for my fonts

### What I struggled with

I struggled the most with deploying my project. I only deployed my project (Ruby on Rails) on a different application once, so it was very challenging. It took me hours to try to fix my issues, and in the process of making my app deployable, I messed up my backend. With assistance from my dad, I had to temporarily delete the front end and make a new repository for it. 

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project, such as:

* Concepts of basic backend programming with Node.js and Express
* Saving user data using MongoDB Atlas. 
* More advanced CSS, such as importing fonts, using custom cursors, different CSS options, etc.
* The basics of deploying on Vercel and Railway
